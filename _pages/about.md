I am a first year PhD student at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) (MPI-SWS), based in Kaiserslautern, Germany.
I am advised by [Viktor Vafeiadis](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~viktor/). My current research focuses on weak memory models. 
I have previously worked on fuzz testing and application security solutions.
